This is a very basic application that basically is a "Fake" Stock exchange. It allows a registered user to Buy shares, Sell them, or Look up the shares of some company based upon their ticker symbol.
Yahoo Finance is used to pull the relevant stock details(like current price, High, low).

I got the idea for this while going through Harvard University's extension school course CS-75(http://www.cs75.net), its an opencourseware and I would absolutely recommend it and some other such open courses the links of which you can find from cs75's page, the course provided the specification for this as a project assignment.

WARNING:- This app has NO styling in it(So no CSS). I wanted to focus myself only on the core functionalities of this app.Needless to say it only has very basic HTML forms, fields etc.
