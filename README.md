This is a very basic application that basically is a "Fake" Stock exchange. It allows a registered user to Buy shares, Sell them, or Look up the shares of some company based upon their ticker symbol.

I got the idea for this while looking through Harvard University's extension school course CS-75(http://www.cs75.net), they provided the specification for this as a project assignment.

WARNING 1:- This app is yet not complete, so if you are reading this 1st warning that means I haven't completed it yet.

WARNING 2:- This app has NO styling in it(So no CSS). I wanted to focus myself only on the core functionalities of this app.Needless to say it only has very basic HTML forms, fields etc.
